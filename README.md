# Simple GitHub Pages Site

This repository hosts a minimal static page for GitHub Pages.

The site consists of a single `index.html` file that displays **Hello World**.

A workflow in `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` automatically deploys this file whenever changes are pushed to the `master` branch.
